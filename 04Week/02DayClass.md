## Title

### Project Objective
<!-- In this section we tell the students what they will achieve by the end of the class. For us its a way to set up a goal and reverse engineer it.  -->

### Example
<!-- A picture, mock-up or demo of what they will bring. Link to a website in the wild would be really cool! -->

### Instructions
<!-- There should be clear step by step instruction so the material can be asyncronously consumed. This will significantly help our students learn, review and improve your teaching experience.  -->
1. _first instruction
2. _second instruction
3. _third instruction...


### Follow-up Video
<!-- This video will come from ACA. It should be a place that helps them understand the material on a deeper level.  -->

## Review and Further Practice
<!-- Link to a challenge to use the same skill but in a different project that doesn't have step-by-step instructions. This is for the more advanced students and for students to continue practicing btw, during and after sessions.  -->
It would be good to include a stretch exercise (differentiated teaching) for each class.
