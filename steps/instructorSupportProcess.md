# Instructor Support: Process

## The Tools and Techniques We use to Support Instructors

### End of Class Feedback & Attendance Code

At the end of every class, students are given the daily attendance code to check-in in for the class but before they submit the code they are asked to rate the **In-class Instruction** and **Pre-Homework** on a 1-5 star scale along with the option to give comments about how the class went are how they're doing in class. 

Every Friday, these rating and comments are collected into an email and sent to each Instructor, the Campus Director, CEO, and Curriculum Director.

### End Of Course Evaluations

On the last day of each course students are asked to respond to the [End of Course Evaluation](https://forms.gle/y1yyCUyRQ1M2ZfoUA). The feedback of this evaluation is shared with the Campus Director, Instructor, and CEO.

### Continuous Instructor Feedback

#### Class Structure
Class structure is important to keep students engaged and learning. Also, it's important that instructors are also giving students plenty of time to work on projects in class for support. 
* Beginning of Class Instruction: 
    * Presentations: Giving students who are presenting extra encouragement
    * Whiteboarding: Participate and helping students as needed; Are students leading the discussion or is the instructor? The students should be participating just as much or more than the instructor.
* Middle of Class Instruction:
    * Q&A: Is the instructor opening it up for students to feel comfortable asking questions? Is the instructor answering the questions? Are they ending questions at a reasonable time?
* In-Class Projects: **MUST START AT 7:30** to give students time to work in class; encourage instructors to not lecture after the project has been reviewed.
