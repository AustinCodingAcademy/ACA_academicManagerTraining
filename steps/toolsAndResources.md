# Our Culture and Our Values

## How It All Started

Austin Coding Academy began all because a couple entrepreneurs realized it was incredibly hard to get into the tech world if you didn't go that direction straight out of high school. Even with the advent of boot camps, the cost and commitment were so high many people were excluded from the development work opportunity. At ACA, we are driven to provide quality instruction to all of our community, from all walks of life with all different backgrounds.

Checkout the story from the eyes of it's co-founders, Luke and Chris.

## Why Do We Do It?

Teaching in itself it purposeful work. We are using our skills and knowledge to help grow other people around us. We are cultivating skills and minds to be better. This is our purpose at ACA, to grow, become better, and to offer to our community an affordable option to get into a better paying and more valuable career.

## Our Mission in the Classroom

ACA hires full-time developers to be part-time instructors. This model allows us to offer an affordable education without quitting their own full-time job or family.

Everyday students enroll into ACA, read ACA textbooks, attend ACA classes, build projects with ACA instruction and work in careers that satisfy them because they graduated ACA. We have a lot on our plate but we also have a lot to be thankful for.

In the classroom, we have just one more day to bring student's closer to their dream job. One more day to bring them closer to understanding. One more day to giving their families more vacation time. And one more day to bring them personal satisfaction.

Our Instructors must bring to the students our knowledge of the field, industry, science and the current curriculum to serve them on their individual tasks for that day.

## What Can You Do in the Classroom

As an Academic Manager, you should provide your students with compassion for the extra work that must be put in now while also challenging them to grow through each runtime error or failure to build.

Your students will look up to you and lean on you for support. This carries with it a certain amount of power. Use this power to influence each student to work with integrity, quality and tenacity. Teach each of your students that this industry thrives on hard work and constant need for improvement.

You will also work with instructors to help improve class instruction and student cooperation both in and out of class.
