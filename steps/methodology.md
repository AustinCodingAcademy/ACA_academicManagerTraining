# Methodology

* Every class begins with a student presentation at 6:30pm *5 minutes*
 * Web 101 - students present either on a topic they are familiar with from their past experience
 * 211/221 - Given a prompt in the textbook, student’s present on workflow and efficiency as well as unique programming concepts
 * 311/321 - Students present to the class over pre-homework
 * 411/421 - Students present to the class over their app, their challenges, and plans.
* Given whiteboarding challenges, a randomly chosen student will work to solve it aloud at the whiteboard while all other students actively work by themselves to work through the challenge. *15 minutes*
* Using the provided key questions, the Instructor asks specific students to answer questions based on their studying the night before. This is meant to lead an active discussion and not to be a lecture. *25 minutes*
* Strictly at 7:30pm: Instead of lectures, students spend in-class time working on achievable learning projects with the help of a developer in the room. Because of this students must spend time before class reading, watching and practicing their homework. *90 minutes*
* Every other class ends with Interview Questions to answer in a Medium blog. These questions prepare students for interviewing by covering broader concepts than covered in class as well as teaching the student’s to clearly work through their thought process. 

## Hands-On

Explain the importance of each and how to implement them.

* Student Presentations
* Daily Whiteboard Trainings
* Q/A On-Homework - Randomizer
* Teachable moments
* Use the whiteboard to draw pictures to help students struggling with concepts. Why images are so important
* Always coding/code planning by 7:30
