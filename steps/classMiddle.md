# Middle of the Course - Weeks 3 - 6

Weeks 3 - 6 seem easy. The class is off to a good start, students understand the responsibilities and expectations, the instructor has settled in, and you are cruising right along. This is how it should be but remember that maintenance is key. Each of your students will experience turbulence in their personal life and in their learning experience. It's up to you to check in on each of them every week, support them with tutoring, guidance, and patience.

## Wk 3, 4, & 6: Monitor Grades and Attendances

Regularly monitor the grades and attendance of students. If a student misses a single day you should know why. If they miss a blog post or daily assignment you should ask how you can help catch them up. It's a delicate balance between supporting them and overbearingly pressing them. You'll find it!

1. **Attendance**
    Students that are not showing up to class are typically falling behind in assignments, learning, and motivations. It is SO IMPORTANT to catch this early! We must be vigilant about the attendance of each of our students if we intend for each of them to be successful. You can do this through Campus Manager by going to the class and checking in on attendance records of the whole class or each student. Remember to document your interactions with students in hubSpot.
1. **Assignment Completion**
    Another indicator of student progress is the completion of assignment. Our students have so much going on in their lives that the will sometimes decide not to complete and assignment or turn it in late. It's so damaging to the student's focus and stamina if they let assignments pile up. They start feeling behind and overwhelmed. To help guide them through the course successfully, be sure to reach out to them any time you see a missing assignment. Offer to help or find a tutor that can get them moving along. Remind them there is no shame in getting help. The most important part is that they continue learning and building.Remember to document your interactions with students in hubSpot.
