# Middle - Weeks 3 - 6

Weeks 3 - 6 seem easy. The class is off to a good start, students understand the responsibilities and expectations, the instructor has settled in, and you are cruising right along. This is how it should be but remember that maintenance is key. Each of your students will experience turbulence in their personal life and in their learning experience. It's up to you to check in on each of them every week, support them with tutoring, guidance, and patience.

## Weeks 3 & 4

Regularly monitor the grades and attendance of students. If a student misses a single day you should know why. If they miss a blog post or daily assignment you should ask how you can help catch them up. It's a delicate balance between supporting them and overbearingly pressing them. You'll find it!
