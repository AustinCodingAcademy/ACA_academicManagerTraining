# End - Weeks 7 & 8

The end of class is an important time for the school and the Campus Director. This is the time students are building projects with the skills they've learned while also considering their finances, interest level, and confidence to move forward into the next term. Because of all of these feelings moving around the Campus Director must steer the students in the direction that would be best for the student.

## Week 7

### Matriculate Students

Now is the time to have conversations with students about their interest in moving on to the next course. Without involving financial details, find out what the student enjoys and if they'd like to continue. These conversations are best done in-person but can often be started by giving a class announcement about the next term and registration information.

#### Invite Students

Use Google Calendar to create events and invite the students to it. This is often the best way to put a bug in their ear, share pertinent information, while giving them space to contemplate on their own. In the invite you should include:

  * Name of Class
  * Location, date, time
  * Instructions on how to register
  * Notifications: 1 week, 2 days, 1 hour
<!-- @TODO add a doc with the info and a screenshot of a calendar invite -->
Here's an example of a [class invite](https://TODO.com).

#### Send Matriculation Email

Share with the students how excited you are for them to continue their journey and make another step closer to their new career. Use this moment with them to gauge interest and intent on moving to the next class. This email should include:

  * Name of Class
  * Location, date, time
  * Instructions on how to register
  * Ask them to respond with their intention

#### Text and rocketChat

We all get caught up in our own struggles. Each of your students will be grappling with the chaos of life, work, family, and school so much they may not see your email or understand the importance of responding. They may even simply be overwhelmed and procrastinate on their responsibilities. That's okay, you can approach them with kind words and understanding to solicit a response from them. Open conversations with:

  * "Hey Matt, I'm going through registrations and I don't see your name. Need any help registering for next class?"
  * "Hey Lisa, I don't see your name in Advanced class. You still in it to win it?"
  * "Hey Jasmine, how's it going?"

## Week 8

At the end of class you will need to wrap the course up, organize tasks, and ensure everyone has a wonderful experience as they leave us.

### Matriculate Remaining Students

#### Follow Up

Record each of those students that haven't registered and be sure to talk with them before, outside, or after class about their plans for next course. If you don't see them call them, send them a text. Make sure you have an understanding as to why they don't want to continue or why they do. This information is useful to you and the school so keep notes and come back to them.

### Collect Keycards

As the last class day approaches prepare yourself for collecting and organizing keycards from graduating students or those that are not matriculating. The keycards need to kept in order and ready for the next students to come through.

### Get Feedback

At the End of the Course it is best to take 5-10 minutes of class time to allow students to complete the [EOC Survey](https://TODO.com). The information we gather here is so valuable for the instructor, you, the school, and the students. Everyone wants to be heard and seen. By giving the students a place to vent or share their thoughts they trust us even more. On top, we stand to gain from their experience. We get a chance to improve our practices for future students.

### Schedule Time with the Instructor

Instructor evaluations conclude with a low-pressure reflection period. This is best done over tacos. Find a time that works for you and the instructors you're working with to eat and discuss their class experience, concerns, and thoughts for the future. Try to get multiple instructors together so they may confer with one another on the hand-off of one term level to the next. Ensure they all feel supported and free to advocate for themselves and their students.
