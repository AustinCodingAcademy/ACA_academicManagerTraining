# End of the Course - Weeks 7 & 8

The end of class is an important time for the school and the Campus Director. This is the time students are building projects with the skills they've learned while also considering their finances, interest level, and confidence to move forward into the next term. Because of all of these stirring feelings abound the Campus Director must steer the students in the direction that would be best for the student.

## Week 7

Now is the time to have conversations with students about their interest in moving on to the next course. Week 7 and 8 are all about moving into the next course. Without involving financial details, find out what the student enjoys and if they'd like to continue. These conversations are best done in-person but can often be started by giving a class announcement about the next term and registration information. Use the checklist below and it'll be smooth sailing.

## Week 7 Checklist

1. Create Google calendar invitation for next course
1. In-class announcement with next course's details
1. Email students a reminder to register
1. Follow-up with holdouts and advise

### Wk 7: Create Google Calendar Invitation for Next Course

Use Google Calendar to create events and invite the students to it. This is often the best way to put a bug in their ear and share pertinent information while giving them space to contemplate on their own. In the invite you should include:

  * Name of Class
  * Location, date, time
  * Instructions on how to register
  * Notifications: 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour

Here's an example of a [class invite](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XMflBCjNivL69KqOEiNGGZw-WwlrHwDpgKUB5K6f6k/edit?usp=sharing) for Google calendar.

### Wk 7: In-class Announcement with Next Course's Details

Talking to students in-person is always best. They like seeing your face and love knowing you got their back. When you announce the next course remind them:

1. Start date
1. Days of the week
1. Register to get pre-course work
1. Why they should move forward!
1. What they will learn in the next course.
1. Ask them to accept the calendar invite so they have a reminder (this also helps you track which students are planning to register.)

Friendly suggestion: write the important details on the whiteboard so you don't have to repeat them.

### Wk 7: Email Students a reminder to Register

Share with the students how excited you are for them to continue their journey and make another step closer to their new career. Use this moment with them to gauge interest and intent on moving to the next class. This email should include:

  * Name of Class
  * Location, date, time
  * Instructions on how to register
  * Ask them to respond with their intention

#### Text and RocketChat Reminders

We all get caught up in our own struggles. Each of your students will be grappling with the chaos of life, work, family, and school so much they may not see your email or understand the importance of responding. They may even be overwhelmed and procrastinate on their responsibilities. That's okay, you can approach them with kind words and understanding to solicit a response from them via rocketChat or text. Open conversations with:

> "Hey Matt, I'm going through registrations and I don't see your name. Need any help registering for next class?"

> "Hey Lisa, I don't see your name in Advanced class. You still in it to win it?"

> "Hey Jasmine, how's it going?"

## Week 8

At the end of class you will need to wrap the course up, organize tasks, and ensure everyone has a wonderful experience as they leave us.

### Week 8 Checklist

1. Discuss with Instructor future teaching opportunities
1. Follow-up on remaining students
1. Collect Key cards
1. End of Course Evaluation Feedback from students

### Wk 8: Discuss with Instructor future Teaching Opportunities

Similar to an exit interview, take time with your Instructors to reflect on the course with them and talk about their interest in teaching another course in the future.

#### Schedule Time with the Instructor to Meet after Class

Instructor evaluations conclude with a low-pressure reflection period. This is best done over tacos. Find a time that works for you and the instructors you're working with to eat and discuss their class experience, concerns, and thoughts for the future. Try to get multiple instructors together so they may confer with one another on the hand-off of one term level to the next. Ensure they all feel supported and free to advocate for themselves and their students.

### Wk 8: Follow-up on Remaining Students

Record each of those students that haven't registered and be sure to talk with them before, outside, or after class about their plans for next course. If you don't see them call them, send them a text. Make sure you have an understanding as to why they don't want to continue or why they do. This information is useful to you and the school so keep notes in hubSpot and come back to them later if and when you need them.

### Wk 8: Collect Key Cards

As the last class day approaches prepare yourself for collecting and organizing key cards from graduating students or those that are not matriculating, as well as, the Instructor. The key cards need to kept in order and ready for the next students to come through.

### Wk 8: End of Course Evaluation Feedback from Students

On the last day of each course, post the EOC Survey in rocketChat and set aside 5-10 minutes of class time to allow students to complete the [EOC Survey](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d99ZNONx6Y2XC8DCv_yisiwDUXL1CM5EuV4md1OVyv8). The information we gather here is so valuable for the instructor, you, the school, and the students. Everyone wants to be heard and seen. By giving the students a place to vent or share their thoughts they trust us even more. On top, we stand to gain from their experience. We get a chance to improve our practices for future students.
