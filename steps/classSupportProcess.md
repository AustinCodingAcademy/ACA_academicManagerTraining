# Course Support: The Life Cycle and Nature of a Course

As with anything, each of the course you support have a cycle: the beginning, middle, and end of each course. These phases come with their own tasks and procedures that help guide the course as a whole, each student, and the Instructor toward success. Let's take some time to explore these phases and their needs.

To be clear, we are talking about the entire cycle of the course not just a single class day. In the following pages we'll talk about the steps to be taken during these three stages but let's take a moment NOW to discuss class structure of each individual class day.

## Daily Class Structure

### Part-time Learning Using a Flipped Classroom Approach

Because classes only meet twice a week we don't have time to waste on lectures. Students must be working on projects and practicing these skills with the guidance of an professional developer as their safety net when they stumble. To do this we use the [Flipped Classroom Approach](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCIxikOq73Q). Learning in this different style can be a hard adjustment for some. It's your job to help the Instructor and students to make the transition and get comfortable with this method and get total buy in so all are headed toward success. Read through and learn what adjustments you need to make in your mind about a Flipped Classroom in this [article](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/flipped-learning-0).

### What the Students and Instructors Need to Know about Learning in a Flipped Classroom

In the traditional classroom, the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set outside of class time.

In a *Flipped Classroom* students are required to study the content that would be provided in the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and fiddling with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved for questions and small discussions of the content and related topics that leads to dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, while grappling with coding challenges. 

To be successful in a part-time program students must study the pre-homework assigned to them **BEFORE** class. The study time should be used to work through the reading, extended articles, watch the provided videos, and complete the given practice problems. All of the content provided is directly coordinated with the in-class lesson/project. This is why it is key for students and instructors to study the pre-homework the day before class.

This approach may feel difficult at first but this methodology has been proven effective and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education. Check out the video below for a clearer understanding.

### What In-Class Structure Looks Like on the Daily

Class structure is important to keep students engaged, confident, trusting in the class, and most importantly, learning! By following class structure the Instructor can confidently approach class with an agenda and plan of action that allows the students time to work on their projects and learn by practice rather than by meandering on their own outside of class.

To reiterate, following the structure of class has multiple important purposes:

1. Give students confidence in the class, the plan, the curriculum, and the school.
1. Helps the Instructor quickly and confidently plan for class.
1. Lowers the amount of time required of the Instructor outside of class.
1. Provides adequate time for students to practice their skills with the safety net of a professional developer on-hand. 
1. Ensure uniformity and quality assurance across the courses, their curriculum, our campuses, and our students education.

#### The Actual Structure

1. **Daily Student Presentations** *(5-10 mins)*: Pre-assigned, two students per day will present to the class on a topic related to what they're learning but are not familiar with may not be covered extensively in the pre-homework or lesson plan. The Goal of these presentations is two-fold:
    1. Expand the students' understanding of programming and knowledge base
    1. Strengthen their presentational and public speaking confidence and skills.
1. **Whiteboarding** *(10-15 mins)*: Kept hidden from the students, these whiteboarding challenges are in given to the Instructor in the textbook. Each day a student will work at the board in-front of the class working through the problem of the day while the Instructor plays the part of a **very friendly** interviewer and the rest of the class plays the part of an participatory audience. This should be a group exercise and not have the feel of a solo journey. The goal is the build the students recognition of problem solving pattern and build their confidence in approaching these problems.
1. **Question for Discussion** *(15-20 mins)*: Given to the students and instructor in the pre-homework and lesson, these questions are intended to serve as a starting point for discussion. Remember, we don't have lectures in a flipped classroom. Instead, students have a dialogue with each other and the instructor about the content cover the day before. This is an opportunity for students to dig deeper into what was covered and get things explained in a different way that what they read or saw in the pre-homework. These questions should be asked and answered by the students with the guidance of the instructor to ensure there is no misinformation. *Remember: Student focused!*
1. **Project Demo and Instructions** *(5 mins)*: While the students should have already read through the lesson instructions, this time should be used to give an overview of the project and it's objectives so students have a clear vision ahead and get a chance to ask clarifying questions.
1. **Project Time** *(90 min)*: With a mandatory start time of 7:30 p.m. this section is the most important time of class. This is the section of class where students get to work together on the project of the day while the Instructor floats the classroom making themselves available to students as they have questions and errors.
1. **Push Yourself Further**: Provided at the end of each project these are suggestions for students to attempt when they've completed the main task. 
1. **Blog Interview Questions** *(5 min)*: Given to the students to be completed after every other class, these questions are meant to prepare students for interviewing for their first developer positions by demanding them to explain low-level concepts. The students will have to do extra research on their own to answer these questions but should use the last 5 mins of class to probe the instructor for direction and clarity. 
1. **Attendance Recording**: At the end of **every** class, the Instructor will share with the students the daily attendance code with the students who will then rate the Pre-Class Homework and In-Class Instruction, give optional comments and submit the daily code to be counted present for the day. 

## Summary
 
Every class will be structured this way. In your Instructor Observations you'll be able to follow along with the class formula and find time markers in class to help the Instructor manage the class more effectively.
