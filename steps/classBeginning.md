# Beginning of Course - Weeks 0 - 2

Depending on which term level the class, be it 101, 200, 300, 400, or 500, each will have their various needs. For now, let's cover some of the basics:

## Week 0

Before the class begins you'll need to complete a few steps to guarantee students get certain information and guidance to start off on the right foot.

### Pre-First Day Checklist    
  <!-- @TODO add link to video for adding members to a channel -->    
1. Create RocketChat Channel + Add Members
1. Pre-planning with Instructor
1. Plan Student Orientation
1. Assign Key cards/fobs
1. Send Pre-Course Work/Welcome Email
1. Schedule a Tutor for the First Days

#### Wk 0: Create RocketChat Channel + Add Members

All classes use RocketChat to share information and communicate about assignments and group projects. Each cohort will be assigned a channel and they will use that channel from day 1 through graduation and beyond. In this way the students will have eternal access to all information they've seen through it and collect everything in one place. Because of this, instructors will have join or be added to each channel at the beginning of each new course. 

1. Create rocketChat channel in the following format: `ACA_Cohort-3_2019 ` or `TTHCCA_Cohort-1_2019`.
    1. Add students and instructor to the new channel.
    1. Share the [Campus Tour Acknowledgment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdftyuaXSe3RbnqSF9PsbUoaibI_vxispj_pa6SkNi63aKcaQ/viewform) form in the rocketChat channel with `@all` in the post.
    1. Post [User Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaGwT-9UU5wf5qowFis2j75L75GWIQMFHOSmpl3B1DzwO1qg/viewform) in the new rocketChat channel with `@all` in the post.
    1. Plan [orientation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qS8aNoKiW03AXsCZ5rCWEXHdfjdqpavLN3u_ySYqm_U/edit?usp=sharing) for students and post in the new channel with `@all` in the post.

#### Wk 0: Pre-planning with Instructor

In preparation for the class and Instructional development you will need to meet with your instructors before the class begins to ensure they understand the content, expectations of them and their students as well as plan out observation times and personal goals, as per the Instructor Evaluation Form.

1. Meet with the Instructor of each course
    1. Review and confirm the Instructor understands the course content and objectives of the course.
    <!-- @TODO @DanielMutter add link to instructor evaluation form. -->
    1. Discuss and plan Instructional goals along with Observation times.
    1. Be sure to ask about special needs and adapters for monitors or projectors they Instructor may need.

#### Wk 0: Plan Student Orientation

On the first day of class you will be responsible for setting the tone fo the course. Yes, the instructor will take over leadership fo the class but it is up to you to kick the student learning experience off with a bit of realization and encouragement. While the first day of each course will differ due to the fact that students are either just starting with us or simply starting a new course, it is critical that the Campus Director is there to welcome and charge students up for the challenges ahead. 

1. Plan Student Orientation for 1st day to encourage and share pertinent information
    1. Different for each course level
    1. If Web 101, plan [appropriate icebreakers](https://www.thoughtco.com/classroom-ice-breaker-31410).
    1. Plan the [student orientation deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qS8aNoKiW03AXsCZ5rCWEXHdfjdqpavLN3u_ySYqm_U/edit?usp=sharing).
    1. Use [this example orientation](https://vimeo.com/331898781/2ad01f206e) to get the feel for it.

 The student will need to get pertinent information like:

  * their rocketChat Channel name
  * directions to restrooms, water fountains, and exits
  * access to complete the [facility tour form ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdftyuaXSe3RbnqSF9PsbUoaibI_vxispj_pa6SkNi63aKcaQ/viewform)
  * share attendance recording procedure
  * contact information for Campus Director and Instructor
  * trajectory of all courses; Goal vs Process
  * Responsibilities of students in a Flipped Classroom
      * Explain Student Presentations
      * reinforcement of the need for them to learn on their own
      * plant the seed for them to know they will be creating an app to build for graduation
      * encouragement to push forward and trust the process
      * how to schedule a tutor and the need for tutors and a learning community
  * Use this [video](https://vimeo.com/331898781/2ad01f206e) for an understanding of how orientation should go
  * And this [orientation slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qS8aNoKiW03AXsCZ5rCWEXHdfjdqpavLN3u_ySYqm_U/edit?usp=sharing) to start your own orientation off right!
  <!-- @TODO @DANIEL copy my orientation slide deck over into a folder called Resources in the Campus Director folder for easy access -->

#### Wk 0: Assign Key cards/fobs

Depending on your campus, students may need key cards or fobs to enter the building. If this is the case it is important to do these few steps. 

1. Assign key cards/fobs (if needed). Be sure to create a spreadsheet that matches student names to card numbers.
1. Share the [User Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaGwT-9UU5wf5qowFis2j75L75GWIQMFHOSmpl3B1DzwO1qg/viewform) in their rocketChat channel.
1. Require all students to complete the User Agreement form before the receive their key.

#### Wk 0: Send Pre-Course Work/Welcome Email

Student coming to us for Web 101 need to be sure they are going to the right location, they will meet you and others that work for the organization at the location, and dates and times are confirmed. It is absolutely vital that the Campus Director greets students first with a cheerful and invigorating email that communicates clearly when, where, and what students need to do to arrive to class on-time and with confidence!!

Use this [example welcome email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xnKxNggyqmkNjFdsc0GRK_Cv52TSeXYArpJofbSqkA0/edit?usp=sharing) to send your first Welcome/Reminder Email.

Be sure to share with all of your students the following information:

1. Location
1. Start and End Time
1. Parking and Keycard information (if necessary)
1. Textbook location details
1. Final payment requirements
1. Pre-Course work expectations
1. Instructor and Campus Director contact info: rocketChat and Email

**Here are example Pre-Class Welcome/Reminder Emails:**

* [NYE Web 101 Email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GyjYldRp9ds_VxUL-2dyrFjP47sZXH1NlyORLKhLb6s/edit?usp=sharing) 
* [JS 211 Email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/174NK3Kxh_bVvnl7gHIbpAgt6ffuiDcQle_RRleGrToQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* [JS 311 Email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/101usKCCjMvzVYshMGQX_xRsfj8vLEkktz3YJ9wJ99v8/edit?usp=sharing)
* [JS 411 Email](https://google.com)
* [Grad Placement 501 Email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Ay9JS1-0T2Sxx88-71lbhE8CoQZBz1HkY62G-LmxA0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Respond to Student Questions**

As the first day of each class approaches, your students will have lots of question. They will be unsure of pre-course work or afraid they shouldn't continue. The best strategy you can use here is to answer **quickly**. Regularly check your email and rocketChat to field student and instructor questions.

#### Schedule a Tutor for the First Days

While the tutors are usually requested for one-on-one coaching of students and holding study sessions, it's best to have an extra set of hands and eyes to guide the first two days of class off to a smooth sail. Be sure to book a tutor from the website and let them know when and where you'll need them.

<!-- @TODO @KATIE @DANIEL -->

<!-- Does a test need to go here? If we have all of these tests will it be hard to keep up with each one and assess their understanding? At the same time, if we have only one it will be harder for the candidate to remember all of the information they covered.... Maybe we have a long form open book test at the end we use to assess their understanding but have shorter quizzes throughout to reinforce the concepts. If so we should email them their responses and allow them to see the correct answers. -->

<!-- @TODO Create and add quiz link @KATIE @DANIEL -->
