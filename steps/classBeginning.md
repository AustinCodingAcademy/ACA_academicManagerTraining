## Beginning - Weeks 0 - 2

Depending on which term level the classes is, be it 101, 200, 300, 400, or 500, each will have their various needs. For now, let's cover some of the basics:

### Week 0

#### Send Pre-Course Work & Welcome Email

Before the class begins the Campus Director will need to share with all the students of the class information:

* Location
* Start and End Time
* Parking and Keycard information
* Textbook location details
* Final payment requirements
* Pre-Course work expectations
* Instructor and Campus Director rocketChat and Email

#### First In-Class Instructor Observation

<!-- @TODO @KATIE @DANIEL -->
add instructions and example emails and folder for finding information.

#### Monitor Grades and Attendances

<!--  Quiz TIME?? -->
<!-- @TODO @KATIE @DANIEL -->

<!-- Does a test need to go here? If we have all of these tests will it be hard to keep up with each one and assess their understanding? At the same time, if we have only one it will be harder for the candidate to remember all of the information they covered.... Maybe we have a long form open book test at the end we use to assess their understanding but have shorter quizzes throughout to reinforce the concepts. If so we should email them their responses and allow them to see the correct answers. -->
