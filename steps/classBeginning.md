## Beginning - Weeks 0 - 2

Depending on which term level the class, be it 101, 200, 300, 400, or 500, each will have their various needs. For now, let's cover some of the basics:

### Week 0

Before the class begins

#### Send Pre-Course Work & Welcome Email

Before the class begins the Campus Director will need to share with all the students of the class information:

* Location
* Start and End Time
* Parking and Keycard information
* Textbook location details
* Final payment requirements
* Pre-Course work expectations
* Instructor and Campus Director rocketChat and Email

Here's an example of a [Web 101 Email](https://TODO.com), [JS 211 Email](https://TODO.com), [JS 311 Email](https://TODO.com), [JS 411 Email](https://TODO.com), [Grad Placement 501 Email](https://TODO.com)

#### Respond to Student Questions

As the first day of each class approaches, your students will bombard you with questions. They will be unsure of pre-course work or afraid they shouldn't continue. The best strategy you can use here is to answer quickly. Regularly check your email and rocketChat to field student and instructor questions.

#### Prepare Orientation Presentation

On the first day of class you will be responsible for setting the tone fo the course. Yes, the instructor will take over leadership fo the class but it is up to you to kick the student learning experience off with a bit of realization and encouragement. The student will need to get pertinent information like:

  * rocketChat Channel
  * restrooms and facility tour
  * attendance record procedure
  * tutor locator
  * contact information
  * trajectory of course
  * reinforcement of the need for them to learn on their own
  * reminder to create an app to build for graduation
  * encouragement to push forward and trust the process
  * Use this [video](https://vimeo.com/331898781/2ad01f206e) for and understanding

<!--  Quiz TIME?? -->
<!-- @TODO @KATIE @DANIEL -->

<!-- Does a test need to go here? If we have all of these tests will it be hard to keep up with each one and assess their understanding? At the same time, if we have only one it will be harder for the candidate to remember all of the information they covered.... Maybe we have a long form open book test at the end we use to assess their understanding but have shorter quizzes throughout to reinforce the concepts. If so we should email them their responses and allow them to see the correct answers. -->

<!-- @TODO Create and add quiz link @KATIE @DANIEL -->
