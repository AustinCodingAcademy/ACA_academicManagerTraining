# Hiring Tutors

## Tutor Job Description

Tutoring at Austin Coding Academy or any of it campuses is more than an internship to organize office supplies, run errands and get coffee. As a Tutor you are expected to grow as a developer while growing your students in programming and coding. We hire our graduates as tutors because we believe in the strength of our students, our school, and the community they are willing to give back to.

While tutoring, we intend for Tutors to develop their "code speaking" abilities. The opportunity to learn and grow in your new craft is available to you and you should take full advantage of this time to not only give back to others but to learn for yourself what it means to convey meaning in code to another person. It is our greatest hope that Tutors are able to deepen their understanding of programming and software development concepts while giving back, growing their community and network, and the Austin Coding Academy community while seeking full-time development work. We are family here.

## What We Look For in Tutors

Of course, attendance and assignment completion is important in to deciding if a graduate will make a good tutor. But finding great tutors is what we're aiming to do.

When looking for tutors ask candidates why they want to tutor. Responses should be in-line with our company mission: "Everyday, make ourselves better while making other around us better." The tutor should want to share their knowledge, give back to students, grow in their own abilities, and care about the community and it's people just as much as you, the Campus Director, does.

## Expectations and Commitment of Tutors

### Expected Availability

Tutors are expected to maintain fairly open schedules to accommodate the number of students with a multiplicity of varied schedules to book tutoring times. These schedules should always be up-to-date and in-line with student needs.

### Expected Coffee Shop Hours (Code with Confidence)

The tech industry has always been filled with individuals wanting to be a part of a community and contribute to projects bigger than themselves. Study groups promote the Coding Academy's culture needed to carry our graduates into the tech world and for them to come back and contribute to the success of younger students behind them. The continual give-and-give process starts with the Tutor.  Tutors are expected to hold regular study groups at a coffee shop or one of ACA’s campuses to lead the students in weekly study sessions. These sessions should build community while working through the week’s challenge. The location and time of “Coffee Shop” hours can be decided in-class with the convenience of the tutor and students in-mind. It is the job of the tutor to inform and invite students to Code with Confidence study sessions.

### Expected In-Class Time

On occasion, Instructors are in-need of extra eyes and minds in the classroom. For this reason Tutors should try as best as possible to be available for class-times when an Instructor might ask you to come in.

If you are asked to come into class, please come in an hour before and let the students of the class know you will be there and what time to expect you. Due to the limited time we have students in class it is of importance we provide Students, Instructors and Tutors with efficient use of their time and energies.

While in class, you as the Tutor should engage students with questions about their current code, challenge them with explaining their process to you as well as guiding them in group discussion. Your job is never to give answers, give up or tell them to quit. You should encourage and guide them but to do this you must be proactive. To do this simply walk up to the computer and ask to be their [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).

### Expected S.P.L.A.T. Policy Compliance

S.P.L.A.T. is an acronym for our style of passing on, maintaining and growing in-house knowledge in our ACA family that also contributes to the our online and in-class community!

Stack Overflow is a great resource for the seasoned developer. But as a fresh-eyed coder it can be intimidating and confusing. To aid our students in learning how to Google to figure out a solution to their problem we use Hack Overflow. Think of it as StackOverflow with training wheels.

On [Hack Overflow](https://austincodingacademy.com/forum/) topics are broken down into classes and because previous students have worked on the same or similar challenges the questions they ask are likely to be the same, giving future students a better chance to develop faster and contribute back sooner!

It work like this:

1. Access [HackOverFlow](https://austincodingacademy.com/forum/) from Campus Manager. (Waffle Icon > Hack Overflow)

  If a student has a question, you should immediately ask them: “Did you splat it?”

1. **SEARCH** for the question on Hack Overflow
  …if you don’t find what you’re asking for:
1. **POST** the question on Hack Overflow.They should ask the question clearly, add tags, links, screenshots and in-line code (use single back-ticks ` `` ` wrapped for in-line code) and code blocks (wrap the code with three back-ticks ```  ``````  ``` .)
1. **LINK** your new topic in a message on an appropriate RocketChat channel! This way people can answer the question, share it with the school and then you and everyone else can find it faster.
1. **ASK** your question with the linked Hack Overflow post on RocketChat, then @ your instructor to answer it. (@all or @my.instructors.name)
1. **TEACH** the solution. This is the *most important part*. If you know the question is up go and answer but also encourage students to answer if they know as well as adding new post for things they learn on their own. 

### Expected Reporting

As the Campus Director, it is your goal to support every student as they move through our program so they feel valued, cherished, confident and accomplished. Because of the limited hours in a class, meeting two days a week and many other tasks you are likely unable to get a personalized chat with each one every day.

To help you accomplish this tasks, Tutors, are asked to relay concerns of a student’s performance to the Campus Director as well as the attendance of students at Code with Confidence coffee shop hours.

## Final Thoughts

Life is about being good to yourself and others around. Caring for people and having others care for you. Let’s come together, share knowledge, help each other out, enjoy a life together and grow together!!
Don’t underestimate the power of sharing what you know. It always comes back around!
