# Instruction Support: Building Relationships

##Mind-set for working with Instructors
Instructors have a wealth of knowledge and insights into programming that our students are going to find valuable. Our mission is to connect instructors with students on an authentic level to ensure all of our students succeed at learning a new skill set to improve their lifestyle and provide for their families.

To successfully communicate and establish quality relationships with instructors at ACA the Campus Director should:

* Relate and connect with Instructors
* Honest and direct feedback 
  * This goes both ways: by asking questions that help instructors see more possibilities of doing something better, we are opening a conversation to making ACA better for students as well. 
* Validate and identifying effective teaching skills
  * Instructors spend most of the time prepping, teaching, and reflecting, so it’s important to share back with them the difference of the work they are putting into teaching. 
* Encourage 
  * Provide the big picture; the students that they are teaching are going to use the information in their future careers.
* Students get jobs, let’s share!
