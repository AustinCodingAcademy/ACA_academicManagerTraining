# Instruction Support: Building Relationships

## Mind-set for working with Instructors

Instructors have a wealth of knowledge and insights into programming that is incredibly valuable to our students. To ensure our students benefit the most from this source od knowledge, our Instructors must be fully committed to the culture and values of Austin Coding Academy. Your goal with instructors is to connect with them on an authentic level. Instructors should feel just a valued and just as much part of the community as our students.

To successfully communicate and establish quality relationships with instructors at ACA the Campus Director should:

### Relate and Connect with Instructors

  * Talk with them before class about their day.
  * Get to know who they are by asking about what they like to do.
  * Do they have family? Passions? Hobbies?

### Honest and Direct feedback

  * This goes both ways: by asking questions that help instructors see more possibilities of doing something better, we are opening a conversation to making ACA better for students as well.
  * Respond to their emails and messages quickly and succinctly. Our instructors will value your short response time and respect of their time.

### Validate and Identifying Effective Teaching Skills

  * Instructors spend most of the time prepping, teaching, and reflecting, so itâ€™s important to share back with them the difference of the work they are putting into teaching.

### Encourage

  * Provide the big picture. Instructors usually teach only one course. Because of this they don't clearly see the entire life cycle of our students. Talk with them about their place in the entire course and how they might be able to teach to the skills students are learning now in context of the other classes.
  * Get their buy in! The skills their teaching our students are skills they will use in the future to embark on new careers! They are **directly** shaping the life of each of our students!!

### Students get jobs!

* When they do, share it with the instructors! This is another point of validation!
