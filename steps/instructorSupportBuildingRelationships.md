# Instruction Support: Building Relationships

## Instructors, Tutors, Announcements, & Curriculum

We want our students to be successful through the process of learning web development. This process requires maintaining quality instructor feedback, tutor feedback & management, providing important information, as well as using feedback to make ACA Curriculum better. 

###Campus Manager Administration

ACA uses our in-house management system [Campus Manager](https://campus.austincodingacademy.com/#users/5b43b1b15ca8d30014dddfa9) to manage classes, students, instructors, textbooks, attendance and grades. 

  - Courses *Search by instructor or class*
    - Take notes for students who are missing more than 2 assignments or have missed more than 2 classes
  - Admin-Users *Search for individual students or staff info*
  - Admin-Terms *Can add or edit new classes*
  - Admin-Textbooks *Access to all textbooks for reference*
  - The Student Handbook can also be found through the waffle icon at the top of Campus Manager
  - Student's View: ACA employs recent graduates as [tutors](https://austincodingacademy.com/tutors/) to help students outside of class. You can guide students to find tutors from Campus Manager by clicking on the waffle icon at the top.
  - Student's View: Also from the waffle icon you can find ACA's [Calendar](https://calendar.austincodingacademy.com/) of events.

###RocketChat Admin/ Announcements

Like Slack, we use [rocketChat](https://chat.austincodingacademy.com/) to maintain a single platform of communications. This should be treated as any chat platform at work.
