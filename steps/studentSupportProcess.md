#Student Support: Process

There are many tools and procedures we use to ensure quality and efficiency while supporting our students. Remember, each of our students are like family, they are important, they're unique, and they're trusting us with their time, money, and mind. Please take some time to review these important techniques to connect, reach out, follow up, and support students. These techniques are broken up into three different sections: **Retrieve Data**, **Document Data**, and **Follow Up With Data**

## How Do We Retrieve Data?

### Attend Class

- Campus Directors attend each class at least once a week to monitor the quality of class instruction, instructor/student engagement, and student comprehension and progression.

    * Anytime you see a student, say "hi!", give 'em a fist bump, high five or ask how they're day is. 
    * While you're hanging out with them before class ask students how their projects are going, what they are working on, or how they are doing over all.
    * As you spend time in class, walk around and pat shoulders, look at their work, and ask if they can explain why they're doing what they're doing to you. The trust you build during this time will prove invaluable to both you and the student.
    * After class make sure you're open to questions and concerns student might want to bring up to you. Invite after class talking and hanging out so the student always know this is a community to gather around and be a part of.

### Communicate with your Instructors

- Instructors are on the frontline with our students. They are regularly grading the students' assignments and hearing the questions they ask, and reading their blogs. The Instructor is in the know when it comes to how the student's are progressing.

    * Regularly communicate with instructors to gain better insight into classroom successes as well as areas for improvement.
    * Ask Instructors how you could help them engage students better.

### Use your Tutors

- Tutors see the students in one-on-one scenarios and often find themselves in conversation with the students that highlight their struggles. Communicate with tutors about students' learning trends including assignments or concepts that students commonly find difficult.
    * Send emails and rocketChats to each tutor to get their thoughts on students they've worked with.
    * Engage the tutors in conversation outside of class where they might more easily show you how students are progressing.

### RocketChat/Email/Text**

- [RocketChat](chat.austincodingacademy.com) is a the community forum. Instructors and students post questions, answers, and support material in their class's channel everyday. This is a prime place for you to passively monitor what students are thinking about, struggling with, and getting excited about.

    * Regularly monitor each of your classes' channels. Make this a daily habit.
    * Use emojis and gifs to encourage and applaud student engagement.
    * Share with student resources they may find useful in their current tasks.

### Weekly Feedback Reports

- Every Friday morning you and your instructors will be sent a Weekly Feedback Reports which will include all the students rating and comments for the past two class days. These are valuable insights on how the student understand the textbook and in-class instruction.

    * Be sure to read the [Weekly Feedback Reports](https://campus.austincodingacademy.com/#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) each week and [follow up with students](https://campus.austincodingacademy.com/#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) that give below 3 stars or leave concerning comments.

- **Campus Manager**
    - Regularly review student attendance and grades in Campus Manager.



## How Do We Follow Up With Data:

- **Class Announcements**
    - Classroom Information: Wifi, locations, times, parking, door codes/keys, textbook, holidays, schedule changes/cancellations, specific class updates, and meet recording links
    - Hackathons: A great way to build community and get students excited about coding by taking part in a real-life coding challenge. 
    - Happy Hours: These events are important for marketing to new students but also helps to foster a community or family feel with our current students.
    - Tutoring Weekends: This weekly event helps foster community and collaboration by bringing students together from different classes to work on code.
    - Photoshoots: Provides free headshots for students and an opportunity for ACA to share students stories with potential new students. 


- **In-Person Conversations**
    - In person conversations are often the best way to follow up with students about attendance, grade, or other course issues. 


- **Text Message or Phone Call**
    - Text messages and phone calls are a good starting point for reaching out to students that may not be as comfortable talking in person.


- **Email**
    - Email is another good way to reach out to students. 


## How Do We Document Data:

- **Hubspot** 
    - We use Hubspot to locate student contact information. Make a new note in Hubspot after each conversation in person, by phone, text, RocketChat, or email.
