## Student Support: Process
There are many tools and procedures we use to ensure quality and efficiency. Please take some time to review the information here. It is broken down into three different sections: Retrieve Data, Document Data, Follow Up With Data

## How Do We Retrieve Data:

- **Being Present In Class**
    - Attend class sessions to monitor the quality of class instruction and student comprehension. Anytime you see a student, greet them. Before class, ask students how coding is going, what they are working on, or how they are doing. 


- **Instructor**
    - Regularly communicate with instructors to gain better insight into classroom successes as well as areas for improvement.


- **Tutors**
    - Communicate with tutors about students trends including assignments or concepts that students commonly find difficult.


- **RocketChat/Email/Text**
    - Regularly monitor communication channels for student and instructor messages. 


- **Weekly Feedback Reports**
    - Review Weekly Feedback Reports for valuable student feedback on course work and instruction. 


- **Campus Manager**
    - Regularly review student attendance and grades in Campus Manager.



## How Do We Document Data:

- **Hubspot** 
    - We use Hubspot to locate student contact information. Make a new note in Hubspot after each conversation in person, by phone, text, RocketChat, or email. 



## How Do We Follow Up With Data:

- **Class Announcements**
    - Classroom Information: Wifi, locations, times, parking, door codes/keys, textbook, holidays, schedule changes/cancellations, specific class updates, and meet recording links
    - Hackathons: A great way to build community and get students excited about coding by taking part in a real-life coding challenge. 
    - Happy Hours: These events are important for marketing to new students but also helps to foster a community or family feel with our current students.
    - Tutoring Weekends: This weekly event helps foster community and collaboration by bringing students together from different classes to work on code.
    - Photoshoots: Provides free headshots for students and an opportunity for ACA to share students stories with potential new students. 


- **In-Person Conversations**
    - In person conversations are often the best way to follow up with students about attendance, grade, or other course issues. 


- **Text Message or Phone Call**
    - Text messages and phone calls are a good starting point for reaching out to students that may not be as comfortable talking in person.


- **Email**
    - Email is another good way to reach out to students.
