#Student Support: Process

There are many tools and procedures we use to ensure quality and efficiency while supporting our students. Remember, each of our students are like family, they are important, they're unique, and they're trusting us with their time, money, and mind. Please take some time to review these important techniques to connect, reach out, follow up, and support students. These techniques are broken up into three different sections: **Retrieve Data**, **Document Data**, and **Follow Up With Data**

## How Do We Retrieve Data?

### Attend Class

- Campus Directors attend each class at least once a week to monitor the quality of class instruction, instructor/student engagement, and student comprehension and progression.

    * Anytime you see a student, say "hi!", give 'em a fist bump, high five or ask how they're day is. 
    * While you're hanging out with them before class ask students how their projects are going, what they are working on, or how they are doing over all.
    * As you spend time in class, walk around and pat shoulders, look at their work, and ask if they can explain why they're doing what they're doing to you. The trust you build during this time will prove invaluable to both you and the student.
    * After class make sure you're open to questions and concerns student might want to bring up to you. Invite after class talking and hanging out so the student always know this is a community to gather around and be a part of.

### Communicate with Your Instructors

- Instructors are on the frontline with our students. They are regularly grading the students' assignments and hearing the questions they ask, and reading their blogs. The Instructor is in the know when it comes to how the student's are progressing.

    * Regularly communicate with instructors to gain better insight into classroom successes as well as areas for improvement.
    * Ask Instructors how you could help them engage students better.

### Use Your Tutors

- Tutors see the students in one-on-one scenarios and often find themselves in conversation with the students that highlight their struggles. Communicate with tutors about students' learning trends including assignments or concepts that students commonly find difficult.
    * Send emails and rocketChats to each tutor to get their thoughts on students they've worked with.
    * Engage the tutors in conversation outside of class where they might more easily show you how students are progressing.

### Follow RocketChat

- [RocketChat](chat.austincodingacademy.com) is a the community forum. Instructors and students post questions, answers, and support material in their class's channel everyday. This is a prime place for you to passively monitor what students are thinking about, struggling with, and getting excited about.

    * Regularly monitor each of your classes' channels. Make this a daily habit.
    * Use emojis and gifs to encourage and applaud student engagement.
    * Share with student resources they may find useful in their current tasks.

### Read Every Week

- Every Friday morning you and your instructors will be sent a Weekly Feedback Reports which will include all the students rating and comments for the past two class days. These are valuable insights on how the student understand the textbook and in-class instruction.

    * Be sure to read the [Weekly Feedback Reports](https://campus.austincodingacademy.com/#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) each week and [follow up with students](https://campus.austincodingacademy.com/#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) that give below 3 stars or leave concerning comments.

### Monitor Grades and Attendance

- [Campus Manager](https://campus.austincodingacademy.com) is a the single most important tool you have to organize and maintain student progress. In Campus Manager we can see a student's entire portfolio including: the picture, contact info, classes they've taken and are attending, the attendance rate, grade, links to their assignments, and payment history.

    * Twice a week you should review student attendance and grades.
    * Use this time to take notes of students and of Instructor grading habits (the students will do better with faster grading).

## How Do We Document Data?

### HubSpot

- Maintaining accurate and judicious notes on each student is crucial to all parts to the student experience from application and admission to graduation and job placement. Your entire team will use [HubSpot](https://app.hubspot.com/login) to track each students journey throughout their time with us because knowing the student is key to placing them in their first developer role.
    
    * Marketing will create the contact of the student and generate notes on their Campus of interest and potential for class.
    *  Each time Admissions interacts with a student they will make notes on who they are, why they're interested, when they'd like to join, and what makes them a great fit.
    * The Campus Director will make notes of each student whenever their is a conversation about financial matters, struggles in class, family or personal hardships, successes in class or when a student realizes they enjoy a certain section of the course.
    * The Director of Job Placement will use all of these notes to connect students to the right employers when they see a potential fit. This is the reason notes on students are incredibly important!!

## How Do We Follow Up With Data?
*(In order of preference.)*

### RocketChat

- Remember, rocketChat is our community bulletin board. Use Direct Messages(DMs) to help student find a tutor, work through a small problem, or ask them about attendance or missing assignments.

### Text Message

- Text messages and phone calls are a good starting point for reaching out to students that may not be as comfortable talking in person or non-responsive via email or rocketChat. Let's face the facts, we live in a text message driven society. Everyone texts, everyone looks at their phones and everyone communicates and hides behind texts.

    * Use texting to follow-up with a student on a conversation you had in-person.
    * Text them to remind them about events like happy hours and hackathons, if you feel they may find a way to back out.
    * Send messages to student that may have had to drop out or wait for the next cohort just to keep in touch.
    * You can even use texting to reach out to student who leave concerning comments.

### In-Person Conversation

- In person conversations are often the best way to follow up with students about attendance, grade, or other course issues. It usually prove useful to try to take the student aside before class away from other students and staff.

    * Most of the time these conversations are fairly easy. You greet them with mild concerns and they realize they've been dodging the problem in their own life and come to an understanding.
    * Sometimes these are conversations about finishing payment for the course. These are only harder because it can be a tender sometimes shameful experience for the student. They can become defensive to protect themselves and you should know they are intending to take this out on you. Nor are you to engage with them anymore than to remind them you are there to support them, understand their struggle, and want to help them in anyway you can.

### Email

- Email is a great way to reach out to students, so long as you've properly introduce them to email etiquette and email expectations, i.e. reading and responding within one day, using reply all or not, adding a signature. Common emails you might send:

    * [Welcome to the first day](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGsK6I19jiZsTUq-qlJ_c5PHR1W40OL4v8Q2hk8cAvo/edit?usp=sharing) of class!
    * [Matriculation Email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DptVyz4yTSNRgY5xzTsiLjgxMQRlztTkRdWdETomUGE/edit?usp=sharing) to help students register for their next class.
    * Grade or Attendance Concerns
    * Invitations and Meetup suggestions

### Class Announcements

- You are the face to the Coding Academy! You are the supporter and knower of all information for students. It is your prerogative to engage the students at the top of class to give them critical information, reprimand them for not do pre-homework, rally their enthusiasm, and encourage them to join happy hours, hackathons, and job faires.
    * Be prepared to give them pertinent classroom information like Wifi, parking info, keycards, textbook notes, holidays, schedule changes/cancellations, specific class updates, and meet recording links.
    * You'll do well to invite them to Hackathons: A great way to build community and get students excited about coding by taking part in a real-life coding challenge with other developers.
    * Get their butts to Happy Hours: These events are important for marketing to new students but also helps to foster a community among our current students and graduates.
    * Implore the students attend Tutoring Weekends: This weekly event builds the school's community and collaboration by bringing students together from different classes to work on code with the help of tutors.
    * Educate them on the importance of Photoshoots: Provided on-occassion, we offer free headshots for students and an opportunity for ACA to share students stories with potential new students.
