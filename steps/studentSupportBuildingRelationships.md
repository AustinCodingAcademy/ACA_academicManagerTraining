# Student Support: Building Relationships

Students come to ACA with a multitude of different experiences, skills, and learning styles but all of them are looking for the same things: new careers, meaning, purpose, and value. We can meet every one of these expectation by create community. To do this we must connect with each student on an authentic level.

To successfully communicate and establish high-quality relationships with students the Campus Director must:

## Meet Students Where They Are

You will be interacting with students at the end of their workday or after dropping their kids off; sometime after a bad or long day, others in depressed days. Each student will come to you with their own emotional whirlwinds and agendas. The Campus Director shows up wherever and whenever the student is with a smile and a high five. Greet the student every time you see them, respond to their messages and emails with an understanding in your heart that they are struggling through something and you are there to listen and guide.

## Encourage Your Students to Improve

Remind students of [growth mindset mentality](https://youtu.be/hiiEeMN7vbQ) - they can constantly improve even when they donâ€™t feel like they are making progress. Develop encouragement statements to keep in your pocket to remind the students: "You are not alone." "You are not the only one to have struggled through this." "You got this!" "We've got you!"

## Relate To Students by Sharing And Connecting

Find moments to share stories to connect with students to gain their trust and build their confidence. We all want to know we're not alone. Remember, we are a community, not one of our students is alone. Ever.

## Listen To Their Stories

Everyone wants to be heard. Just as each student is in a different place when they come to us, each student will be in their own place while learning. Take the time to listen to each student. You should know what their current job, husband/wife/single/kids and what they like to do on their free time. By taking the time with each student in this way, you will create a genuine connection and know how best to serve them when they do struggle.

## Don't Force Interactions & Empathy

Not all interactions have to be before, during, or after class. Sometimes sending a RocketChat or text message just to check-in can make a difference between a student speaking up & passing or remaining silent & failing.

## Act Assertively When Necessary

While it is your job to support and nurture the growth and learning of our students, at times the class and instructor may need your outside input to steer a student/instructor back on track. This may include difficult meetings, requesting to talk outside, or calling in a supervisor to help you navigate the situation.

## Show Up to Class w/o Interrupting Flow

Know when to speak and when to sit back. While the instructor is speaking let the students listen to them. During group work, jump into discussions with students with genuine interest. Use this time to connect with them over code! You can also use what you learn there as a topic for follow-up later on. The long and short: practice empathetic human behavior. Talk with your students, listen to them, react, laugh, joke, encourage, and support them!
