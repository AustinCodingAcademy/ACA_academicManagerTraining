# Student Support: Building Relationships

Students come to ACA with a multitude of different experiences, skills, and learning styles. Our mission is to connect with each student on an authentic level to ensure all of our students succeed at learning this new skill set to improve their lifestyle and provide for their families.

## To successfully communicate and establish quality relationships with students at ACA the Campus Director should:

- **Meet Students Where They Are**
    - You will be interacting with students at the end of their workday or after dropping their kids off. Each student will come to you with their own emotional whirlwinds and agendas. The Campus Director shows up wherever and whenever the student is with a smile and a high five.

- **Encourage Your Students to Improve**
    - Remind students of [growth mindset mentality](https://youtu.be/hiiEeMN7vbQ) - they can constantly improve even when they don’t feel like they are making progress. Develop encouragement statements to keep in your pocket to remind the students: They are not alone. They are not the only ones to have struggled through this. And they are going to succeed!

- **Relate To Students by Sharing And Connecting**
    - As a graduate of the program, you probably have many insights that you’ve gained from your learning process at ACA. Find moments to share these stories to connect with students to gain their trust and build their confidence. We all want to know we're not alone.

- **Listen To Their Stories**
    - Everyone wants to be heard. Just as each student is in a different place when they come to us, each student will be in their own place while learning. Take the time to listen to each student. You should know what their current job, husband/wife/single/kids and what they like to do on their free time. By taking the time with each student in this way, you will create a genuine connection and know how best to serve them when they do struggle.

- **Don't Force Interactions & Empathy**
    - Not all interactions have to be before or in the classroom. Sometimes sending a RocketChat or text message just to check-in can make a difference between a student speaking up & passing or remaining silent & failing.

- **Act Assertively When Necessary**
    - While it is your job to support and nurture the growth and learning of our students, at times the class and instructor may need your outside input to steer a student/instructor back on track. This may include difficult meetings, requesting to talk outside, or calling in a supervisor to help you navigate the situation.

- **Show Up to Class w/o Interrupting Flow**
    - Know when to speak and when to sit back. While the instructor is speaking let the students listen to them. During group work, jump into discussions with students with genuine interest. Use this time to connect with them over code! You can also use what you learn there as a topic for follow-up later on.
