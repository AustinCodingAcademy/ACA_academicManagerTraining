# Student Support: Building Relationships

## What Makes Us Different? (The Why)

The personal relationships and community that we build with our students sets us apart from other computer programming skills schools. Our students come from all walks of life and each one has their own hardships, problems, or issues. Students put their trust in us to help pave the way for a better future for them and their families. As Academic Advisors, it is our duty to ensure that students have the best experience possible during their time at ACA. How do we do this?

## Building Student Rapport (The How)

- Arrive early to class and be present for students before and during class sessions
- Assist students without interrupting class instruction
- Keep an eye on student progress and attendance and provide support when students       fall behind
- Encourage students to attend ACA Happy Hours, Hackathons, and Group Tutoring Sessions

## Student Communication (The What)

- Course Manager: Check student grades, attendance, and instructor feedback as well as course textbooks
- Rocket.Chat: Chat platform for sending messages to individual students or entire class sections
- Email, Text, Phone: In addition to in-person communication, reach out to students as needed vie email, text, or phone
- HubSpot: Log communication with students and make notes to track progress
