# Student Support: Building Relationships

Students come to ACA with a multitude of different experiences, skills, and learning styles. Our mission is to connect with students on an authentic level to ensure all of our students succeed at learning a new skill set to improve their lifestyle and provide for their families. 


*To successfully communicate and establish quality relationships with students at ACA the Campus Director should*:

- **Meeting Students Where They Are**
    - You will be interacting with students at the end of their workday or after dropping their kids off. Each will come to you with their own emotional whirlwinds and agendas. The Campus Director shows up wherever and whenever the student is.

- **Encouragement To Improve**
    - Remind students of growth mindset mentality - they can constantly improve even when they don’t feel like they are making progress. Develop encouragement statements you can fallback on and use to remind the students: They are not alone. They are not the only ones to have struggled. And they are going to succeed!

- **Relating To Students- Sharing And Connecting**
    - As graduates of the program, you probably have many incites that you’ve gained from your learning process. Find moments to share these stories to connect with students to gain their trust and build their confidence. 

- **Listening To Their Story**	
    - Everyone wants to be heard. Just as each student is in a different place when they come to us, each one will be in their own place while learning. Take the time to listen to each student so you know how best to serve them. 

- **Non-forced Interactions & Empathy**
    - Not all interactions have to be before or in the classroom. Sometimes sending a RocketChat or text message just to check in can make a difference between a student speaking up and passing or remaining silent and failing.

- **Assertive When Necessary** 
    - While it is your job to support and nurture the growth and learning of our students, at times the class and instructor may need your outside input to steer a student/instructor back on track. This may include required meetings, requesting to talk outside, or calling in a supervisor to help. 

- **Show Up to Class without Interrupting Flow**
    - During group work, jump into discussions with students with genuine interest. Use this time to connect with them over code! You can also use what you learn there as a topic for follow-up later on.
