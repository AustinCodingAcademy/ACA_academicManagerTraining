### Equal Employment Opportunity & Americans with Disabilities Act
  
It is the policy of the Company to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and employment applicants without regard to unlawful considerations of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, marital status or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal laws. This policy prohibits unlawful discrimination based on the perception that anyone has any of those characteristics, or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of those characteristics. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, working conditions, compensation, promotion, benefits, scheduling, training, discipline and termination.
  
The Company expects all employees to support our equal employment opportunity policy, and to take all steps necessary to maintain a workplace free from unlawful discrimination and harassment and to accommodate others in line with this policy to the fullest extent required by law. For example, the Company will make reasonable accommodations for employees' observance of religious holidays and practices unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship on the Company's operations. If you desire a religious accommodation, you are required to make the request in writing to your manager as far in advance as possible. You are expected to strive to find co-workers who can assist in the accommodation (e.g. trade shifts) and cooperate with the Company in seeking and evaluating alternatives.
  
Moreover, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Company provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities to the fullest extent required by law. The Company may require medical certification of both the disability and the need for accommodation. Keep in mind that the Company can only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual. Therefore, it is your responsibility to come forward if you are in need of an accommodation. The Company will engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify possible accommodations, if any will help the applicant or employee perform the job.
  
### Confidentiality
  
In the course of employment with the Company, employees may have access to "Confidential Information" regarding the Company, which may include its business strategy, future plans, financial information, contracts, suppliers, customers, personnel information or other information that the Company considers proprietary and confidential. Maintaining the confidentiality of this information is vital to the Company's competitive position in the industry and, ultimately, to its ability to achieve financial success and stability. Employees must protect this information by safeguarding it when in use, using it only for the business of the Company and disclosing it only when authorized to do so and to those who have a legitimate business need to know about it. This duty of confidentiality applies whether the employee is on or off the Company's premises, and during and even after the end of the employee's employment with the Company. This duty of confidentiality also applies to communications transmitted by the Company's electronic communications. See also Internet, Email and Computer Use policy, herein.
  
As a condition of employment with the Company, all employees must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
  
### Employment of Minors
  
The FLSA's child labor provisions, which the Company strictly adheres to, are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. Generally speaking, the FLSA sets the minimum age for employment (14 years for non-agricultural jobs), restricts the hours youth under the age of 16 may work, and prohibits youth under the age of 18 from being employed in hazardous occupations. In addition, the FLSA establishes subminimum wage standards for certain employees who are less than 20 years of age, full-time students, student learners, apprentices, and workers with disabilities. Employers generally must have authorization from the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) in order to pay sub-minimum wage rates.
  
### Employment of Relatives
  
The Company recognizes that the employment of relatives in certain circumstances, such as when they will work in the same department, supervise or manage the other, or have access to confidential or sensitive information regarding the other, can cause problems related to supervision, safety, security or morale, or create conflicts of interest that materially and substantially disrupt the Company's operations. When the Company determines any of these problems will be present, it will decline to hire an individual to work in the same department as a relative. Relatives subject to this policy include: father, mother, sister, brother, current spouse or domestic partner, child (natural, foster, or adopted), current mother-in- law, current father-in-law, grandparent, or grandchild.
  
If present employees become relatives during employment, the Company should be notified so that we may determine whether a problem involving supervision, safety, security or morale, or a conflict of interest that would materially and substantially disrupt the Company's operations exists. If the Company determines that such a problem exists, the Company will take appropriate steps to resolve the problem, which may include reassignment of one relative (if feasible) or asking for the resignation of one of the relatives.
  
### Personnel Records and Employee References
  
The Company maintains a personnel file and payroll records for each employee as required by law. Personnel files and payroll records are the property of the Company and may not be removed from Company premises without written authorization. Because personnel files and payroll records are confidential, access to the records is restricted. Generally, only those who have a legitimate reason to review information in an employee's file are allowed to do so. Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources will be limited. However, the Company will cooperate with requests from authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required.
  
Employees may contact a Human Resources representative to request a time to review their payroll records and/or personnel file. With reasonable advance notice, an employee may review his or her own records in the Company's offices during regular business hours and in the presence of an individual appointed by the Company to maintain the records. No copies of documents in your file may be made, with the exception of documents that you have previously signed. You may add your comments to any disputed item in the file.
  
By policy, the Company will provide only the former or present employee's dates of employment and position(s) held with the Company. Compensation information may also be verified if written authorization is provided by the employee.
  
### Privacy
  
The Company is respectful of employee privacy. All employee demographic and personal information will be shared only as required in the normal course of business. Healthcare enrollment information is kept in a separate folder from other human resources forms. Workers' Compensation information is not considered private healthcare information; however, this information will be released only on a need-to-know basis.
  
The Company does not make or receive any private healthcare information through the course of normal work. If any employee voluntarily shares private healthcare information with a member of management, this information will be kept confidential. If applicable, the Company will set up guidelines for employees and management to follow to ensure that company employees conform to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
  
### Immigration Law Compliance

In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 on the date of hire and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility within three business days of date of hire. Former employees who are rehired must also complete an I-9 form if they have not completed an I-9 form with the Company within the past three years, or if their previous I-9 form is no longer retained or valid. You may raise questions or complaints about immigration law compliance without fear of reprisal.
  
### Political Neutrality
  
Maintenance of individual freedom and our political institutions necessitates broad scale participation by citizens concerning the selection, nomination and election of our public office holders. The Company will not discriminate against any employee because of identification with and support of any lawful political activity. Company employees are entitled to their own personal political position. The Company will not discriminate against employees based on their lawful political activity engaged in outside of work. If you are engaging in political activity, however, you should always make it clear that your actions and opinions are your own and not necessarily those of the Company, and that you are not representing the Company.
  
## Section 3

Hours of Work and Payroll Practices
  
### Pay Periods and Paydays
  
Employees are paid on a bi-monthly basis. All employees will be paid every other Friday. All employees are paid by check or direct deposit on the above-mentioned payday. If the regular payday falls on a weekend or Company holiday, employees will be paid on the last business day before the holiday and/or weekend.

### Anti- Harassment and Discrimination
  
The Company is committed to providing a work environment free of sexual or any form of unlawful harassment or discrimination. Harassment or unlawful discrimination against individuals on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, marital status or any other classification protected by local, state or federal laws is illegal and prohibited by Company policy. Such conduct by or towards any employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or anyone else who does business with the Company will not be tolerated. Any employee or contract worker who violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of his or her employment or engagement. To the extent a customer, vendor or other person with whom the Company does business engages in unlawful harassment or discrimination, the Company will take appropriate corrective action.

#### Prohibited Conduct
  
Prohibited harassment or discrimination includes any verbal, physical or visual conduct based on sex, race, age, national origin, disability or any other legally protected basis if:
  
 * submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or engagement;
  
 * submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for decisions concerning that individual's employment or engagement; or
  
 * it creates a hostile or offensive work environment.
  
Prohibited harassment includes (but is not limited to) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and lewd, vulgar or obscene remarks, jokes, posters or cartoons, and any unwelcome touching, pinching or other physical contact. Other forms of unlawful harassment or discrimination may include racial epithets, slurs and derogatory remarks, stereotypes, jokes, posters or cartoons based on race, national origin, age, disability, marital status or other legally protected categories. Prohibited harassment might also be transmitted using the Company's electronic communications system, or through other on-line conduct. 
  
#### Complaint Procedure
  
Employees or contract workers who feel that they have been harassed or discriminated against, or who witness any harassment or discrimination by an employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or anyone else who does business with the Company, should immediately report such conduct to their supervisor or any other member of management.
  
Do not allow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting it, regardless of who is creating the situation. No employee, contract worker, customer, vendor or other person who does business with this organization is exempt from the prohibitions in this policy. In response to every complaint, the Company will conduct an investigation which may involve interviewing witnesses if warranted and, if improper conduct is found, take appropriate corrective action.
  
To the extent that an employee or contract worker is not satisfied with the Company's handling of a harassment or discrimination complaint, he or she may also contact the appropriate state or federal enforcement agency for legal relief.
  
### Attendance
  
Punctuality and regular attendance are essential to the successful operation of the Company's business. If an employee is unable to report to work (or to report to work on time) for any reason, the employee must notify his or her supervisor before his or her starting time. If an employee desires to leave work for any reason during the workday, the employee must obtain the approval of his or her supervisor prior to leaving. In the event that the employee fails to call his or her supervisor or report for work for 3 consecutive workdays, the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned from his or her employment with the Company and will be removed from the payroll. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

### Discipline and Standards of Conduct
  
As an at-will employer, the Company may impose discipline whenever it determines it is necessary or appropriate. Discipline may take various forms, including verbal counseling, written warnings, suspension, demotion, transfer, reassignment or termination. The discipline imposed will depend on the circumstances of each case; therefore, discipline will not necessarily be imposed in any particular sequence. Moreover, at any time the Company determines it is appropriate, an employee may be terminated immediately.
  
Every organization must have certain standards of conduct to guide the behavior of employees. Although there is no possible way to identify every rule of conduct, the following is an illustrative list (not intended to be comprehensive or to limit the Company's right to impose discipline for any other conduct it deems inappropriate). Keep in mind that these standards of conduct apply to all employees whenever they are on Company property and/or conducting Company business (on or off Company property). Engaging in any conduct the Company deems inappropriate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
  
#### Dishonesty
  
 * Falsification of Company records;
  
 * Unauthorized use or possession of property that belongs to the Company, a coworker, or of the public;
  
 * Possession or control of illegal drugs, weapons, explosives, or other dangerous or unauthorized materials;
  
 * Fighting, engaging in threats of violence or violence, use of vulgar or abusive language, horseplay, practical jokes or other disorderly conduct that may endanger others or damage property;
  
 * Insubordination, failure to perform assigned duties or failure to comply with the Company's health, safety or other rules;
  
 * Unauthorized or careless use of the Company's materials, equipment or property;
  
 * Unauthorized and/or excessive absenteeism or tardiness;
  
 * Lack of teamwork, poor communication, unsatisfactory performance, unprofessional conduct, or conduct improper for the workplace;
  
 * Sexual or other illegal harassment or discrimination;
  
 * Unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company's confidential information;
  
 * Violation of any Company policy.
  
### Dress Code
  
What we wear to work is a reflection of the pride we have in our Company, in what we do, and in ourselves. Although dress code requirements will vary according to job responsibilities, we ask that your appearance at all times show discretion, good taste, and appropriateness for the safe performance of your job.
  
### Safety
  
The Company is committed to providing a safe workplace. Accordingly, the Company emphasizes "safety first." It is the employee's responsibility to take steps to promote safety in the workplace and work in a safe manner. By remaining safety conscious, employees can protect themselves and their coworkers. Employees are expected to promptly report all unsafe working conditions, accidents and injuries, regardless of how minor so that any potential hazards can be corrected.
  
### Substance and Abuse
  
The Company is committed to providing its employees with a safe and productive work environment. In keeping with this commitment, it maintains a strict policy against the use of alcohol and the unlawful use of drugs in the workplace. Consequently, no employee may consume or possess alcohol, or use, possess, sell, purchase or transfer illegal drugs at any time while on the Company's premises or while using the Company vehicles or equipment, or at any location during work time. 
  
No employee may report to work with illegal drugs (or their metabolites) or alcohol in his or her bodily system. The only exception to this rule is that employees may engage in moderate consumption of alcohol that may be served and/or consumed as part of an authorized Company social or business event. "Illegal drug" means any drug that is not legally obtainable or that is legally obtainable but has not been legally obtained. It includes prescription drugs not being used for prescribed purposes or by the person to whom it is prescribed or in prescribed amounts. It also includes any substance a person holds out to another as an illegal drug.
  
Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
  
Any employee who feels he or she has developed an addiction to, dependence upon, or problem with alcohol or drugs, legal or illegal, is strongly encouraged to seek assistance before a violation of this policy occurs. Any employee who requests time off to participate in a rehabilitation program will be reasonably accommodated. However, employees may not avoid disciplinary action, up to and including termination, by entering a rehabilitation program after a violation of this policy is suspected or discovered.
  
### Workplace Searches
  
All offices, desks, file drawers, cabinets, lockers, Company vehicles, and other Company equipment (including but not limited to computers, e-mail and voice mail) and facilities or any area on Company premises are the property of the Company ("Company Property"), and are intended for business use. Employees should have no expectation of privacy with respect to Company property and/or items stored within Company Property or on Company premises. Inspection may be conducted at any time, without notice, at the discretion of the Company.
  
In addition, when the Company deems appropriate, employees may be required to submit to searches of their personal vehicles, parcels, purses, handbags, backpacks, brief cases, lunch boxes or any other possessions or articles brought on to the Company's premises.
  
Persons entering the premises who refuse to cooperate in an inspection conducted pursuant to this policy may not be permitted to enter the premises. All employees must cooperate in an inspection; failure to do so is insubordination and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
  
### Internet, Email and Computer Use Policy
  
The Company uses various forms of electronic communication including, but not limited to: computers, email, telephones, voicemail, instant message, text message, Internet, cell phones and smart phones (hereafter referred to as "electronic communications"). The electronic communications, including all software, databases, hardware, and digital files, remain the sole property of the Company and are to be used only for Company business and not for personal use.
  
The following rules apply to all forms of electronic communications and media that are: (1) accessed on or from Company premises; (2) accessed using the Company computer or telecommunications equipment, or via Company-paid access methods; and/or (3) used in a manner which identifies the Company. The following list is not exhaustive and the Company may implement additional rules from time to time.
  
 * Electronic communication and media may not be used in any manner that would be discriminatory, harassing, or obscene, or for any other purpose that is illegal, against Company policy, or not in the best interest of the Company. Employees who misuse electronic communications and engage in defamation, copyright or trademark infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, discrimination, harassment, or related actions will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination. Employees may not install personal software on Company computer systems.
  
 * Employee's own electronic media may only be used during breaks. All other company policies, including the Company's no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in the workplace apply.
  
 * All electronic information created by any employee on Company premises or transmitted to Company property using any means of electronic communication is the property of the Company and remains the property of the Company. You should not assume that any electronic communications are private or confidential and should transmit personal sensitive information in other ways. Personal passwords may be used for purposes of security, but the use of a personal password does not affect the Company's ownership of the electronic information. The Company will override all personal passwords if necessary for any reason.
  
 * The Company reserves the right to access and review electronic files, messages, internet use, blogs, "tweets", instant messages, text messages, email, voice mail, and other digital archives, and to monitor the use of electronic communications as necessary to ensure that no misuse or violation of Company policy or any law occurs. All such information may be used and/or disclosed to others, in accordance with business needs and the law. The Company reserves the right to keep a record of all passwords and codes used and/or may be able to override any such password system
  
 * Employees are not permitted to access the electronic communications of other employees or third parties unless directed to do so by Company management. No employee may install or use anonymous e-mail transmission programs or encryption of e-mail communications.
  
 * Employees who use devices on which information may be received and/or stored, including but not limited to cell phones, cordless phones, portable computers, fax machines, and voice mail communications are required to use these methods in strict compliance with the Confidentiality section of this Handbook. These communications tools should not be used for communicating confidential or sensitive information or any trade secrets.
  
 * Access to the Internet, websites, and other types of Company-paid computer access are to be used for Company-related business only. Any information about Austin Coding Academy, its products or services, or other types of information that will appear in the electronic media about the Company must be approved before the information is placed on any electronic information resource that is accessible to others.
  
### Cell Phone Policy
    
The Company may provide cell phone allowances to employees in certain positions in an effort to improve efficiency and effectiveness. When cell phones are used for Company business, employees must comply with all Company policies governing conduct, including our policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and violence in the workplace. When using the cell phone in a public place, please remember to maintain the confidentiality of any private or confidential business information. As a courtesy to others, please shut cell phones off or place on vibrate mode during meetings.
