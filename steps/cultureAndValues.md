# Our Culture and Our Values

## How It All Started

Austin Coding Academy began because a couple entrepreneurs realized it was incredibly hard to get into the tech world if you didn't go that direction straight out of high school. Even with the advent of bootcamps, the cost and commitment were so high many people were excluded from web development and tech industry opportunities. At Austin Coding Academy, we are driven to provide quality instruction to all of our community, from all walks of life with all different backgrounds.

## Why We Do It?

Teaching in itself it purposeful work. But what we teach gives our student purpose and meaning in their lives. Every member of our community from the students, instructors, tutor, Campus Director, and each team member in the office should feel part of a community that is bigger than they are. Every person should feel meaningful purpose in their work. Everyday we use our skills and knowledge to help grow other people around us as well as ourselves. We are cultivating skills and minds to be better, stronger, and more employable. This is our purpose at ACA, to grow, become better, and to offer to our community an affordable option to get into a better paying and more valuable career that will offer to our community members the chance to provide a better life for their families.

Checkout the videos below to learn more about why we come to the office every day to provide a curriculum, learning environment, and organization to build skills, open opportunities, and place graduates.

## Our Mission in the Classroom

ACA hires full-time developers to be part-time instructors. This model allows us to offer an affordable education without quitting their own full-time job or family by paying developer competitive pay for only part-time hours. Because of this, everyday students enroll into ACA, read ACA textbooks, attend ACA classes, build projects with ACA instruction, and work in careers that satisfy them because they graduated from ACA. We have a lot on our plate but we also have a lot to be thankful for.

In the classroom, we foster community. Starting with the Campus Director and Instructor, we engage with students as they walk in with a simple, "Hey, how you doing?" We connect with each student and offer ice-breakers that spark connections and lead our students to feel comfortable with each other and confident to ask questions and try and fail together. Each day is just one more day to bring student's closer to their dream job. One more day to bring them closer to understanding. One more day closer to giving their families more vacation time, hobby time, picnic, and camping. And one more day to bring them personal satisfaction and self-worth.

## What can the Campus Director do to foster community in the classroom

As the Campus Director, you should provide your students with support and compassion for the extra work that must be put in now while they're working full-time to pay their bills, raise their children, and pay tuition. Each of our students will need your encouragement as they are faced with new challenges, runtime errors or failure to build. Your smile and positivity in class will garner their respect and provide to them the support they'll need to win!

Your students will look up to you and lean on you for support. This carries with it a certain amount of power. Use this power to influence each student to work with integrity, pride, commitment, and tenacity. Teach each of your students that this industry thrives on hard work, curiosity, and constant need for self-improvement.

Along with building community amongst the student you will also work with instructors to improve their instructional skills, trust in them, and invigorate them with passion and value in giving to their students the opportunity to grow and provide for their families. The instructors are your front-line soldiers. They will be with the student every day and have the most face time with them. Getting your instructors motivated to build community and support students is key to your success!
