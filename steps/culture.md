# Our Culture and Our Values

* ACA was started for the sole-purpose to lower the financial barrier of entry into the tech industry.
* We change peopleâ€™s lives by teaching them a skill set and way of thinking that gives them purpose and value in a growing industry with major potential.
* By doing this we are making ourselves better while making others around us better.

## How It All Started

Give everyone a background of the company. I love the humble beginnings and I think it really shows-off who we are and what we're about.

## Our Mission

Here we paint with a finer brush to tell our future instructor what we expect and wy we show up in the office everyday.

## What Can You Do?

Offer here a list of attitudes, traits and actions the future instructor can take on for themselves to continue the culture and value system at ACA.

### Test

At the end of each section, a googleForm can be embedded to test there understanding. They should be able to see the results.
